ClearPath

ClearPath is a task management system that help users prioritize and organize their workload. The system calculates task priority using an algorithm and gives insights through visual charts.

So far I have the backend stuff mostly finished I think. I'm currently working on frontend. I also do not have anywhere to host the web app yet and will have to look into ways to get that done.



Features

Backend (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)
- Automatic priority score calculation based on importance, effort, and due date
- Sorting, filtering, and pagination support
- Analytics endpoint returning:
  - Total tasks
  - Completed vs. pending
  - Overdue tasks
  - Tasks due in the next 7 days
  - Priority score distribution

Frontend (React)
- Pages:
  - **Dashboard** — displays analytics summary
  - **Tasks** — displays task list with dynamic data
  - **Insights** — charts showing task analytics



Priority Score Algorithm

This is the current algorithm I'm using, it could change to make it more complex but I went with something simple to start off so that I could get the project going.

priority_score = (importance * 2) + urgency - effort

Where:

- `importance` is from 1 to 5  
- `effort` is estimated hours  
- `urgency = max(0, 10 - days_until_deadline)`
