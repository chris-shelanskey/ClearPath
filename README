Priority Score Algorithm

This is the current algorithm I'm using, it could change to make it more complex but I went with something simple to start off so that I could get the project going.

priority_score = (importance * 2) + urgency - effort

Where:

- `importance` is from 1 to 5  
- `effort` is estimated hours  
- `urgency = max(0, 10 - days_left)`
